# DesignPatterns
  - Design patterns are common solutions for common problems in software design.
  - Each pattern represents an issue that keeps reoccuring.
  - The pattern is not specific piece of code.

### Design Patterns Classification
  - ``Creational Patterns`` are concerned with process of object creation.
  - ``Structural Patterns`` are concerned with how classes and objects composed
  - ``Behavioral Patterns`` are concerned with algorithms

  1) Factory Pattern
       - It is a creational pattern.
       - It define an interface for creating an object. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclass.
       - Advantages of Factory Pattern is, allows the subclasses to choose the type of the objects to create.
